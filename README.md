# MODEL ARCHITECTURE
![RibonanzaNet 3D Architecture](images/ribonanzanet-architecture.svg)

# TODO
1. Implement synth RNA structures
2. Test squeezeformer
3. Test BPPM
4. Research and brainstorm
5. Think about n-gon custom updates/attention (similar to triangle updates but with more (n) attending nodes)
